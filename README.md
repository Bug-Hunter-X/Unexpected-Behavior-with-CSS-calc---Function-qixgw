# Unexpected Behavior with CSS calc() Function

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `calc()` function is powerful for dynamic calculations, but it's crucial to understand its limitations and potential pitfalls.  This example shows situations where unexpected results might occur due to missing parent dimensions, rounding errors, and unit incompatibility.

The `bug.css` file contains the code exhibiting the problematic behavior.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers solutions and best practices to mitigate these issues.

## Issues Addressed:

* **Missing Parent Dimensions:**  `calc()` relies on the dimensions of its parent element. If the parent's dimensions aren't defined (e.g., missing `width` on the parent container), `calc()` might not produce the expected results.
* **Rounding Errors:** Using `calc()` with different units can lead to rounding errors, especially when dealing with decimals.
* **Unit Incompatibility:** Not all units are directly compatible within the `calc()` function. This can lead to unexpected results or even parsing errors.

## Solutions:

* **Ensure Parent Dimensions:**  Always ensure that the parent container of the element using `calc()` has its dimensions clearly defined.
* **Unit Consistency:**  Prefer using the same unit type within the `calc()` expression. This helps avoid rounding issues and increases clarity.
* **Testing & Debugging:** Thoroughly test your CSS, paying close attention to how `calc()` is functioning in different browsers and screen sizes.
