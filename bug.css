The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not defined, or if there are other elements that affect the layout. Also, using `calc()` with multiple units can sometimes lead to unexpected rounding errors.  Another issue is that `calc()` doesn't support all CSS units equally. Using percentages within `calc()` can sometimes produce inaccurate results, especially when dealing with complex layouts.
